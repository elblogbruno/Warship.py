# Unity3D-Python-Communication

‚ö°Ô∏è A very simple, fast, and general inter-process communication example between Unity3D C# and Python, using ZeroMQ.

PS. It looks slow in the GIF above because I put a delay of one second between each message so that you can see it
working.

## Introduction

* Have you ever tried to communicate C# code in Unity3D with Python before but could not find a satisfying solution?
* Have you ever tried implementing communication protocol using file read/write and found out that it's a stupid approach?
* Have you ever tried communicating using Web HTTP request and found out that it's stupidly slow and high latency?
* Have you ever tried communicating using socket/TCP/UDP stuff, but it feels like you are reinventing the wheel and you
  are becoming a network engineer?
* Have you ever tried to communicate by emulating a serial port, and found out that it's not how cool guys do work?
* Have you ever tried to send Unity input to python and do some scientific work (maybe even machine learning task)
  and return the output to Unity?
* Have you ever tried to build a `.dll` from python or even rewrite everything in `C#` because you don't know how to
  communicate between python and C# processes?
* Have you ever tried to embed `IronPython` or `Python.NET` inside Unity but it doesn't allow you to install your
  amazing external python libraries? (And its minimal power is pretty ridiculous compared to your external python)
* Have you ever tried to export a `TensorFlow Protobuf Graph` (Deep learning model) and use `TensorFlowSharp` or
  `OpenCVForUnity` to import the graph inside Unity because you want to use the model to predict stuff in Unity, but it
  doesn't allow you to use/utilize your new NVIDIA GeForce 1080Ti GPU, and it's also hard to code?
* Tried `MLAgents`, anyone?

If you answer **Yes** to any of these questions but it seems you have found no solutions,
then this repository is definitely for you!
(If you answered **Yes to all** questions, you and me are brothers! üòè)

I've tried a lot. With a lot of searching on the internet, I've found no solutions that is simple, fast, and general
enough that I can apply to any kind of communication between Python and Unity3D. All I've done in the past were simply
a hack to either get my scientific computation work in Unity instead of python, or communicate between the processes painfully.

_Until I found ZeroMQ approach from this [repository](https://github.com/valkjsaaa/Unity-ZeroMQ-Example)
(and some head scratching)._

## Solution Explanation

I've built a `request-reply` pattern of ZeroMQ where Python (server) replies whenever Unity (client) requests
a service from Python.

The idea is to create a separate thread inside Unity that will send a request to python, receive a reply and log the reply
to the console.

Most of the code are just copies from the official ZeroMQ tutorial. I try to make this as simple to grasp as possible,
so I only log the message to the console and nothing fancy.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/off99555/Unity3D-Python-Communication.git` command.
2. Open UnityProject (its `dll` files are targeting .NET 4.x version) and run `Assets/NetMQExample/Scenes/SampleScene`.
3. Run python file `PythonFiles/server.py` using command `python server.py` on a command prompt.
4. You should start seeing messages being logged inside Unity and the command prompt.

Specifically, Unity will send request with a message `Hello` 10 times, and Python will simply reply `World` 10 times.
There is a one second sleep between each reply on the server (to simulate long processing time of the request).

Please read the comments inside `PythonFiles/server.py` and `UnityProject/Assets/NetMQExample/Scripts/` and you will
understand everything more deeply.

**The most important thing is that you should follow the 4 getting started steps first. Don't skip it!** ‚ù£Ô∏è

After you've understood most of the stuff but it's not advanced enough, you should consult the official
[√òMQ - The Guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all).

## Requirements

* [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) is a very fast messaging library and it's simple enough that a few lines of code works.
* [PyZMQ](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the Python bindings for ZeroMQ. You can install it using
  `pip install pyzmq` command or see more installation options [here](http://zeromq.org/bindings:python) or
  [here](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq).
* [NetMQ](https://netmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a native C# port of ZeroMQ. Normally you need to install this using
  `NuGet` package manager inside `Visual Studio` when you want to build a .NET application, or you could install using
  `.NET CLI`. But for this repository here, you don't need to do any of the installation because we've already included
  `AsyncIO.dll` and `NetMQ.dll` for you inside `UnityProject/Assets/NetMQExample/Plugins/` directory.
  If you want to build your own `dll` files, please take a look at
  [this issue](https://github.com/valkjsaaa/Unity-ZeroMQ-Example/issues/7).

## Troubleshooting

* While running both servers and clients, I kill the server process, and they don't work anymore. Is this a bug?

  No, this is the expected behavior of ZeroMQ because of the simplicity of the code. It's mentioned in the guide
  [here](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Ask-and-Ye-Shall-Receive). If you want to make the code better, which is not
  the focus of this example, you can learn more about ZeroMQ as suggested in the screenshot below.

## TODO

* [ ] Add example that use Unity's Update() method to receive reply instead of using a separate thread to continuously
    call `TryReceiveFrameString()` in a loop without any delay. This means that
    the call to `TryReceiveFrameString()` will not be too frequent which yields better performance. It will be called
    only about 60 times a second if the frame rate is 60 FPS inside Update() method.
    The benefit of no separate thread is that there will be no thread-swapping overhead.
